The 11th of February 2022 was a landmark day for entrepreneurs and start-up enthusiasts of IIT Roorkee alike, as the much-anticipated Hult Prize competition started its first round of elimination. The competition, which has been held annually for the past few years, is a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their innovative ideas and gain exposure to potential investors and industry leaders. The topic of this year was “Redesigning fashion to be sustainable”.

The Hult Prize competition not only provides a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their ideas, but it also provides a valuable opportunity for networking and learning. The competition provides a valuable opportunity for entrepreneurs to connect with like-minded individuals, learn from experienced entrepreneurs, and gain exposure to potential investors and supporters.

The competition was fierce, with each team given just twelve minutes to pitch their idea and convince the panel of judges why their start-up was worth investing in.

The judges, made up of the members of the Hult Prize organising committee, were impressed by the high quality of the presented ideas. The first round went on for more than five hours. After each of the teams pitched their idea, the judges shared their thorough feedback on how to improve their ideas or pitches.
