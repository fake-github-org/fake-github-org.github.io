Making the shift from the academic world to the corporate world can be a daunting task. As a student, I had always imagined the workplace to be a world away from the comfortable confines of my university campus. While I had heard many stories about the challenges of transitioning from campus to corporate, I was determined to make the most of this year’s Placement Season. Through this diary, I hope to give readers an insight into what my placement journey entails and provide some useful tips for those embarking on a similar journey. So sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and join me as I take you through my journey from campus to corporate!

## To give you some context, here’s a bit about who I am… 

Currently, enjoying the final few days left here at IIT Roorkee, I am Rochak, a senior in Electronics and Communication Engineering, Department. I interned at Citibank, this summer as a Technology summer analyst intern after securing a place in the on-campus internship recruitments. I worked diligently to convert my internship opportunity into a full-time job offer, which was a decent achievement given the stressful economic conditions of the recession and market irregularities. However, before proceeding, I asked myself a pivotal question: Was this the extent of my aspirations or did I want to challenge myself and participate in the intense, nerve-wracking, yet exhilarating placement season of Fall 2022? Answering this question was a significant undertaking, and even my friends were divided in their opinions.

On one hand, some people thought I would accept the job offer due to the current market and hiring scenario. On the other hand, those who knew me well believed that I wouldn't settle for it. This is where self-efficacy, one of the most critical factors for placements, came into play. Self-efficacy is the belief in oneself to push beyond limits and achieve any set goal. With this in mind, I was ready to embark on the journey that we had all been preparing for, little realizing how it would have a lasting impact on our lives.

## Preparing for the Season

Now, the most critical part of this journey begins with preparation. This is the factor that will set you apart from the other candidates appearing for the same placements. It was evident from the outset that competition during the placement season would be fierce, and I cannot stress enough the need for you to distinguish yourself from the rest of the crowd, which comprises some of India's brightest minds. However, as I progressed, I began to build my arsenal. Initially, I had the self-belief and motivation to achieve my goal. Next, I required a plan of action - a roadmap with specific events and fixed deadlines. The roadmap should be designed in a way that does not overburden me to the extent that I cannot meet the deadlines, nor should it be too lenient that my preparation falls short.

_A glimpse of my preparation timeline_

The aforementioned aspects may be found in written form and serve as the foundation for your placement journey. However, there are crucial aspects that are often overlooked in success stories, such as having placement buddies and a support system to rely on during this experience. And I would like to dedicate this article to them, my Placement buddies **Amitesh, Shreyank, and Dheeraj**. Without them, I would not have been able to survive this journey. Placement buddies play a crucial role as they are the ones who can understand you in times of need when no one else can. Only your placement buddies can share the joy when a test exceeds expectations or the sadness when you mess up a critical test. As you move forward, preparation also involves preparing for interviews, where you must express yourself and explain why you would be a good fit for the company. While people do emphasize the importance of DSA and CS fundamentals, you also need to demonstrate what sets you apart from the rest.


## The Application Process

Before applying to companies, it was crucial to research potential companies and roles that would be a good fit for you. There is a well-known saying that goes, "if you practice 100 moves once to defend yourself, you will never be able to execute them. However, if you practice one move 100 times, it doesn't matter if you know the other 99 moves; you will be able to execute the one move flawlessly." For me, that one move was software development and quant roles because I have been involved in competitive programming and software development throughout my college years. Additionally, your resume reflects your experiences and interests. If you are unsure about which path to pursue, try writing about your campus experiences, and you will undoubtedly find the answer.

_Resume Format_

Once you have made your resume and you have clarity about the roles/companies you want to sit in, then you’ll need to appear in the tests that’ll test your skills, and they will be tough enough, so embrace yourself while giving them, and be calm even if they don’t go as per your expectations. I too followed the same routine of giving recruitment tests, may it be morning at 8 am, at post-midnight 2 am, or may it be during our fests, there hasn’t been a time in the day when tests haven’t been scheduled, making it hectic, monotonous, and intense all three at the same time. But the key is being patient enough and not losing your calm at any time. I still vividly recall a time when we used to stroll around campus to clear our heads of the stress from the hectic schedule, with the rule of not discussing the ongoing placement season during our walks. Despite having Diwali and our cultural fest scheduled amidst our placement season, we made a conscious decision to enjoy the festivities without compromising on our preparation and tests. As a result, we were able to take a break from our routine without it affecting our performance.

From September to the end of November, I followed this routine for three months, after which the interviews were scheduled in the first week of December. Throughout this period, my friends provided unwavering support, and it was their belief in me that kept me motivated. Not only did they help me maintain the patience required during the process, but they also made it enjoyable and exciting. This was a significant phase in our lives, as we made the transition from a comfortable campus environment to the highly competitive corporate world.

## Interviews and Securing the Placement Offer

Returning to the night of November 30th, I can still vividly recall the palpable tension among all of us scheduled for Day-1 interviews the following day. I had been shortlisted for interviews with several companies, including Sprinklr, SquarePoint Capital, Plutus, SAP Labs, and Oracle. Despite my nervousness, I had one thought in my mind: was I good enough to fit into any of these companies? The competition was intense, and it seemed as though everyone else was better prepared than I was. Hoping for some good luck, I wished for success before moving forward. However, little did I know that life doesn't always work that way. During the first time slot from 12 am to 6 am, I gave three interviews with Sprinklr, SquarePoint (Quant), and Plutus (Quant). Unfortunately, I didn't make it to the second round of any of them. At 5:30 am, I was tired and sleep-deprived, still reflecting on what went wrong and how I could have improved in those interviews. Then, I received a phone call informing me that I had an SAP Labs interview scheduled for 6 am sharp, and I needed to be ready and freshen up. I was barely able to muster the energy for another hour-long interview, but then I remembered that I had been preparing for this moment for the past four months or even the past 3.5 years. 

So, I composed myself, put on my coat, and flashed a smile that I had been saving for this interview. I sat down to give the interview, and to my surprise, the next two hours went smoothly, from the first technical round to the final HR round. Even the HR interviewer commented that I looked fresh, smiling, and confident throughout the interview, despite claiming to have not slept the whole night. Perhaps these were the green flags they were looking for. In the end, I was 70% sure that I might receive an offer, although I acknowledge that there are likely many others who are better than me and could displace me.

Next up, I took a nap from 9 am to 11 am. At 11 am, I received a call for my next interview with Oracle, which was the last interview of the day. I realized that some of the waitlists did not turn into interviews. If I didn't make it through this interview, then it would be the end of my Day-1 interviews. I arrived at the interview by 11:30 am and completed two rounds by 1 pm. However, my interview slot for Oracle had ended, and even though I had a third interview scheduled with them, it was just a stroke of luck. Nevertheless, I was eagerly waiting for the results of my SAP interview, and I was curious to know whether I had made it or not.

This whole time my friends were super supportive around us the ones giving interviews, and when I was done with 2nd slot of the day, they asked me to have lunch, while packing up lunch for others who had their interviews lined up and didn’t have the time to care about it. And then, I got a message, and I yelled, “Bidani, Prajit ho gaya!”, these were my words. I can replay that moment over and over again because it brought such a sense of relief and joy to finally secure a job. After receiving the news, I immediately called a friend who wasn't on campus to share the good news, hoping he could witness my excitement. It's a great feeling to boast that I was placed on the first day at SAP Labs in Bangalore. I can't adequately express this feeling with words alone. Ten of my batchmates also received offers from SAP Labs on that day, and I was among them. Then came the most enjoyable part, conducting post-placement celebrations and letting loose. After all, it had been a long and intense journey, and it was time to have some fun with my colleagues.

## Overcoming Challenges 

One of the difficulties I encountered during the placement season was effectively managing my time and staying on top of important events and deadlines. Despite having specific companies in mind, I sometimes forgot to apply to them because I was too focused on preparing for tests or recovering from exams that didn't go well. The pressure and stress of the season also made it difficult to apply concepts that I had mastered before. As time went on, the repetitive nature of the routine and academic demands added to the challenge. It was crucial to remain composed during this time and remind oneself to stay focused on the task at hand, saying "not today" to distractions and obstacles to keep moving forward.

Maintaining a positive attitude is crucial; all you need is to ace that one test or interview to land your dream job. With this mindset, you should aim to have as many interviews as possible. If you feel that others are better than you, use that as motivation to improve yourself. Remember that there is always room for a hardworking person in this world, and having a hustler mentality is essential for survival.

## Conclusion

_The Day we all got placed and asked our already placed friends to put on suits._

Reflecting on my placement journey, I realize it was a long but significant phase that one must devote to their college journey. It made me understand that anything is achievable if you set your mind to it. You may face disappointments, but they will help you improve and grow. When you set your mind to something, you start thinking of ways to achieve it, and you put in the effort. One more thing, if you plan to sit for placements, start early, even if your friends haven't started yet. There's no harm in beginning early because if you achieve your goal with a headstart, you'll feel good. But when you don't achieve it, you'll regret being late, and I have experienced both. Apart from the conventional advice that you hear, many other aspects contribute to your success, but they remain hidden in success stories. Firstly, you need to be patient and keep your cool while preparing. Secondly, having supportive friends around you can help you immensely (P.S. I have the best ones here in college). These two things cannot be imposed upon you, but they develop over time. That's all from my side. I hope you enjoyed reading my placement diary.
