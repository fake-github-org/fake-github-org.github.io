The event was a success as the students returned with a deeper understanding of the weapons and equipments used by the Indian Army. It was a hot topic of debate during the return journey, who had used which gun in the FPS games that they planned online. ADCI office said that it will continue organising such events in the future also and will try to allot slots so that the event is hassle free and everyone can learn about the mighty weapons in a detailed manner.
